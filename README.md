# Tutorials
Thousands of websites are filled with tutorials on coding. Some are good, some are not so good. Here I have complied the useful things from several tutorial videos and other web contents for people (especially from biology background) who are starting to learn coding. This folder also contains short pieces of code written by me to demonstrate some biophysical phenomena (eg. movement of motor protein). My aim is to encourage biology students (school/undergrad) in using scientific computing to understand the concepts better.

Currently the codes are written using PYTHON but in future I will be adding contents written using JULIA.
