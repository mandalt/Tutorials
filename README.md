# Tutorials
Websites are filled with tutorials on coding. Some are good, some are not so good. Here I have complied the useful things from several tutorial videos and other web contents for people who are starting to learn coding.
Currently the codes are written using PYTHON but in future I will be adding contents on JULIA.
This folder contains short pieces of code written by me and some taken from good tutorial contents on YouTube.
